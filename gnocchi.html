    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>1/½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</ul> 
        <ul>½ onion, finely chopped</ul>
        <ul>1/½ (14.5 ounce) cans passata (crushed tomatoes)</ul>
        <ul>salt to taste</ul>
        <ul>1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
        <ul>1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cubed</ul>
        <ul>4 fresh basil leaves</ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add passata and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Pour 1 ladle of tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Add gnocchi, remaining tomato sauce, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Arrange cubes of mozzarella cheese evenly on top.</li>
    <li>Place baking dish in the oven and broil until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce has slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves before serving.</li>
    </ol>
